# Evidence 1: Implementation of Lexical Analysis Automaton and Regular Expression.
## Description

For this evidence I chose the Sindarin language, created by J.R.R Tolkien and used in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. “It is the most widely spoken Elvish language in Middle-earth during the Third Age, spoken by Men and Elves alike” ( Sindarin Hub, 2024). It is Welsh inspired and has similar sounds and similar phonotactics.

I specifically chose 5 words of this language :

1. Dina - Means ‘Be Silent’
2. Dol - Meaning ‘Head`, often given to hills and mountains 
3. Dôr - Sindarin for 'land'.
4. Draug - 'wolf'.
5. Drego - Sindarin word which means 'Flee'.
